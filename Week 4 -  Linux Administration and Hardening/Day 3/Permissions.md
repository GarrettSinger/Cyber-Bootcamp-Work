## Activity File: Permissions

During the last activity, we cleaned up the system's groups and users and removed all the malicious users. We also removed users from the `sudo` group and found and removed a rogue group.

Your senior administrator now wants you to secure a few important files and directories. Recall that during our scavenger hunt yesterday, we talked about the sensitive files on the system that contain all the users (`/etc/passwd`), the passwords (`/etc/shadow`), and the groups (`/etc/group`).

This activity will give you an opportunity to practice inspecting and setting file permissions on these sensitive files. Use the checklist provided by your senior administrator in the **Instructions** section for information on which files to inspect and modify permissions for.

You'll use the same lab environment you used in the previous exercises:
- Username: `sysadmin` 
- Password: `cybersecurity`

### Instructions

Your senior administrator has asked you to complete the following:

1. Set permissions on `/etc/shadow` to allow only `root` read and write access.

sudo chmod 600 /etc/shadow

2. Set permissions on `/etc/gshadow` to allow only `root` read and write access.
sudo chmod 600 /etc/gshadow

3. Set permissions on `/etc/group` to allow `root` read and write access, and all others read access only.
sudo chmod 604 /etc/group
Ambiguious instruction others vs group and other
sudo chmod 644 /etc/group -correct choice

4. Set permissions on `/etc/passwd` to allow `root` read and write access, and all others read access only.
sudo chmod 604 /etc/passwd
Ambiguious instruction others vs group and other
sudo chmod 644 /etc/passwd -correct choice


**Bonus**

5. Verify all accounts have passwords.
root does not
Many daemons do not
How to check if a user has a password set:
sudo cat /etc/shadow | grep ':\*:' 
Super user do cat (read file) filename pipe to grep search for literal string :*: {This is for daemons}
Look for ! As well to see if there is no password set for users



6. Recall that if any user has the UID of `0`, the system thinks they are `root`. Verify that no users have UID of `0` besides `root`. If you find one that does, change the user's UID to any value greater than `1000`.
No user in passwd has a user ID of 0 besides root
ADAM
Otherwise you would change uid with chmod -u ID# NAME
check with awk -F':' '{print $1, $3}'


7. Provide a list of all permission changes that you make in a text file in your research directory.

Attempt to complete these tasks on your own. If you need help, refer to the further instructions below.

### Further Instructions

- Start by inspecting the file permissions on each of the files listed. Determine if they are already set correctly or if you need to change the permissions.

- Use [this web Resource](https://askubuntu.com/questions/518259/understanding-chmod-symbolic-notation-and-use-of-octal) if you get stuck.

- Verify that all accounts have passwords. 
    - If you get stuck, google how to determine if an account has a password on a Linux system.

- Verify that only the root user has a UID of `0`. 
  
   _**Hint:** This is similar to verifying the password._

- Document all of your findings into a file using `nano`. Keep that file in your research directory.
