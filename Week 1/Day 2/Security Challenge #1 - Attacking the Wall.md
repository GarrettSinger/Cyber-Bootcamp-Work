## Activity File: Security Challenge #1 - Attacking the Wall

In this activity, you will look at various attack strategies that cybercriminals can use to penetrate an insecure login. 

- You and your team have just been hired by a very successful startup, Bitcoin Dating Exchange. 

- While their founding team is brilliant, like many startups, they don’t know the first thing about security.

- They just handed you a lot of money to solve their most critical problem: Their login process is totally insecure. Malicious actors are routinely logging in as users (and administrators) and gaining access to company data and financial assets.

### Instructions

In groups, develop a list of 15 ways that a malicious actor could penetrate the system and login as a user or administrator.

With each method, be prepared to describe the following:
  - Who (or what) is the initial target?
  - How would the actor implement the attack?

Save your answers. You will need them for the next activity, too.   

#### Hints

- While you may be new to this type of thinking, this exercise should force you to think creatively about all the ways a system can be penetrated, from user attacks to physical break ins. 

- To successfully complete this exercise, you must think through creative options. Brainstorm and discuss with your group to devise real-world attack types. 

  Shoulder Surfing - Targets the account of the current user.
  Phishing - Targets the account of the user based on the phishing attack style. (Facebook, Microsoft, Gmail, etc.)
  Password spraying - Attacks bulk users using common passwords to see what works.
  Password Guessing - Attempting to sign into a site or service using password guesses. Often based on OSINT gathering.
  Brute Force - Running a list of known or common passwords agains a single account until you find a working password and username combo.
  Key logging - Key logging malware can be installed to grab the information a user types in.
  Privilege escalation on a compromised machine - Using techniques to elevate privilege from local user to admin user.
  SQL injection - Useing SQL commands to manipulate the database of the site/service.
  Insider threat - Employee trusted with access is compromising the system.
  Session Hijacking - Using another users' session to gain access to a site/service as them.
  Known Vulnerabilities - Scanning a site/service to reveal missed patches or other known vulns.
  

As always, be prepared to share your answers!
