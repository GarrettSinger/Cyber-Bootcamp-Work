## Activity File: Building an IP Lookup Tool  
  
- You continue in your role as security analyst at Wonka Corp.

- Wonka has been experiencing more attacks on their network.

- Your manager wants to know what country these attacks are coming from so Wonka Corp can block the country from accessing their network.

- Specifically, they would like you to design a script that can look up the countries of several IP addresses pulled from the logs.

### Instructions

Using only the command line, change into the `/03-student/day3/IP_Lookup_Tool` directory. From there, complete the following tasks:
  
1. You have been provided a new command to look up details for an IP address:

     - To look up information on the IP of `104.223.95.86`, you would run:  

        `curl -s http://ipinfo.io/104.223.95.86`

       - **Hint:** Read the man page of the `curl` command to learn more about what it can do.

   Using  pipes, `grep`, and `awk`, modify the `curl` command to display only the country.

      - **Hints:**
         - Use `grep` to display only the line that contains the country. 
         - Use `awk` to parse out the country from that line.

curl -s http://ipinfo.io/104.223.95.86 | grep -i country | awk -F'"' '{print $4}'


  2.  Place the command into a new shell script called `IP_lookup.sh`.
nano IP_lookup.sh

  3.  Modify the script so the IP address is an argument that can be passed into the script.
  
#!/bin/bash
curl -s http://ipinfo.io/$1 |grep -i $2| awk -F'"' '{print $4}'

  4. The following IP addresses were found in Wonka's log files. Run your new  `IP_lookup.sh` with these IP addresses as arguments to determine their countries:
       - IP 1: `133.18.55.255` JP
       - IP 2: `41.34.55.255` EG
       - IP 3: `187.54.23.8` BR

#You know what, the last activities didn't have much need for scripting. How about we script a script for the original required script. Insert Yo Dawg meme!

#Create new script with these IP addresses as an array and then cycle the IP_lookup script using the IP addresses in this script.

#New script name: Run_Array.sh

#!/bin/bash

array=('133.18.55.255' '41.34.55.255' '187.54.23.8')
for i in "${array[@]}"; do /bin/bash ./IP_lookup.sh $i; done
