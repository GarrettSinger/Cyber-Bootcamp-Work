## Solution Guide: Internal Investigation: Finding the Kit Cat Burglar

- First, navigate into the `/03-student/day1/find_kit_cat_burglar` folder on your VM. To do this, run the following commands:
  - `cd /03-student/day1/`
  - `cd find_kit_cat_burglar`

-  This directory has folders for evidence gathered from Henry and Ruth.

- Within Henry and Ruth's directories are sub-directories for:
     - Emails
     - Files
     - Logs
     - Other

- To preview all the files in each of these directories and find those that can be used as evidence, you can use `more`, `less`, or `head`.

Grep and find is the answer here. 

sysadmin@UbuntuDesktop:/03-student/day1/find_kit_cat_burglar$ tree|  grep -irl 'secret\|recipe\|slugworth'
henry/files/do.txt
henry/emails/email4
henry/emails/email1
henry/logs/log1
henry/logs/log2
ruth/files/sd.txt
ruth/emails/emailA

# ls -R can be used instead of tree if you do not have tree installed. 
# ls -R |  grep -irl 'secret\|recipe\|slugworth'
  
sysadmin@UbuntuDesktop:/03-student/day1/find_kit_cat_burglar$ find . -type f \( -name "*recipe*" -o -name "*secret*" -o -name "*slugworth*" \)
./henry/other/top_secret/recipe_for_sugarplum
./henry/other/top_secret/recipe_for_sweetums
 
   
- Next, go back to  the `find_kit_cat_burglar` directory, and make a directory called `Evidence_for_authorities`. Run the following command:

mkdir Evidence_for_authorities

- Copy all the evidence files found into this directory. To do this, run the following commands using absolute paths:
            
       cp /03-student/day1/find_kit_cat_burglar/ruth/emails/emailA   /03-student/day1/find_kit_cat_burglar/Evidence_for_authorities
       cp /03-student/day1/find_kit_cat_burglar/ruth/files/sd.txt     /03-student/day1/find_kit_cat_burglar/Evidence_for_authorities
       cp /03-student/day1/find_kit_cat_burglar/henry/emails/email1  /03-student/day1/find_kit_cat_burglar/Evidence_for_authorities
       cp /03-student/day1/find_kit_cat_burglar/henry/emails/email4   /03-student/day1/find_kit_cat_burglar/Evidence_for_authorities
       cp /03-student/day1/find_kit_cat_burglar/henry/logs/log1    /03-student/day1/find_kit_cat_burglar/Evidence_for_authorities
       cp /03-student/day1/find_kit_cat_burglar/henry/logs/log2  /03-student/day1/find_kit_cat_burglar/Evidence_for_authorities
       cp /03-student/day1/find_kit_cat_burglar/henry/other/top_secret/recipe_for_sugarplum    /03-student/day1/find_kit_cat_burglar/Evidence_for_authorities
       cp /03-student/day1/find_kit_cat_burglar/henry/other/top_secret/recipe_for_sweetums  /03-student/day1/find_kit_cat_burglar/Evidence_for_authorities
    
-  The last step is to concatenate all the files together. Move into `Evidence_for_authorities` and run:
   - `cat  emailA sd.txt  email1 email4 log1 log2     recipe_for_sugarplum  recipe_for_sweetums > Wonka-evidence.txt` 

 **Bonus**
 
 - The hidden files are `lp.txt`, `dj.txt`, `bb.txt` and `b7.txt` in Ruth's `files` directory.

 - To change the file extension from .txt to .jpg, run:
   - `mv lp.txt  lp.jpg`
   - `mv dj.txt  dj.jpg`
   - `mv bb.txt  bb.jpg`
   - `mv b7.txt  b7.jpg`
   

 - Open the file to display the images.
